# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @krisan10/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@krisan10/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `head`: A function that will indicate the first value of an array.
* `tail`: A function that will separate the items leading from the head of the array
* `middle`: Afunction that will collect the middle items of an array, both even and odd number arrays.
